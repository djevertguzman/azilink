Description:

AziLink is an Android app that allows application level tethering using USB or Network connection, without requiring root access. Originally it was developed by Jim Perry but since then other developers kept it alive:
Evert Guzman, Jerome Robert and Eugene San. Here is a full list for forks:

AziLink works by using a Java-based NAT that communicates with OpenVPN on the host computer. It's been tested on MacOS, Windows, and Linux. The connection will be forwarded over the phone's active network service, which can be either WiFi or LTE/3G/EDGE.
The app has two different use cases:

- Use Android debugging interface (ADB) to allow tethering when it's not available/limited.
- Use Android mobile hotspot as link layer but route all traffic using Android application layer (thus the traffic seems like it it generated by the phone).

Requirements:

- Network mode:
  * OpenVPN 2.1+ from http://openvpn.net/index.php/downloads.html or your OS repo
  * app-debug.apk from this repo https://github.com/eugenesan/azilink/releases
  * https://github.com/eugenesan/azilink/raw/master/host/azilink_net.sh
  * https://github.com/eugenesan/azilink/raw/master/host/azilink_net.ovpn

- ADB mode:
  * ABD from Android platform tools or your OS repo
  * OpenVPN 2.1+ from http://openvpn.net/index.php/downloads.html or your OS repo
  * app-debug.apk from this repo https://github.com/eugenesan/azilink/releases
  * https://github.com/eugenesan/azilink/raw/master/host/azilink_adb.sh
  * https://github.com/eugenesan/azilink/raw/master/host/azilink_adb.ovpn
  
Installation:

1) Install OpenVPN on the host. Version 2.1_rc15 and 2.3.0 were tested, but any version should work. Apparently if you use version 2.0 you'll need to remove the NO_DELAY option from the aziLink-xxx.ovpn configuration file. You can find OpenVPN at:
http://openvpn.net/index.php/downloads.html

2) (Only for ABD mode) Enable USB debugging on the phone. From the home screen, this is under
Settings>Applications>Development>USB debugging.

3) (Only ADB mode) Install the Android USB driver (if you don't already have one installed).
See http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/device.html for more information.  The driver is included in the ADB download if you don't want to get the full SDK.

4) Install Android platform tools from http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/01/05/google-makes-adb-fastboot-platform-tools-available-without-full-sdk-android-studio-download/

5) Install the program. You can either use ADB to install by typing
"adb install app-debug.apk" with the file at https://github.com/eugenesan/azilink/releases, or point your phone's browser to the same location and install the app (make sure you enabled unknow sources in security settings).

Configuration steps:

1) (Only in ABD mode) On the host, run "adb forward tcp:41927 tcp:41927" to set up port forwarding. Be sure to use adb from the Android 1.1+. (The version from 1.0 will lock up under heavy load!).

2) (Only in Network mode, that part is automated in ADB mode) On the phone, run AziLink and make sure "Service active" is checked.

3) Either run provided scripts from https://github.com/eugenesan/azilink/tree/master/host or right click azilink-xxx.ovpn (abd for ABD and net for Network modes) on the host (not in the web browser!) and select "Start OpenVPN on this configuration file." You can find this file at: https://github.com/eugenesan/azilink/tree/master/host. If you're using Linux or, god forbid, MacOS, you'll also need to manually set the nameserver to 192.168.56.1 (the phone's NAT IP address).  This address is automatically forwarded to the phone's current DNS server.
